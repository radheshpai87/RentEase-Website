            <p>
              RentEase was born out of personal frustration with the traditional rental process. 
              Our founder, Sarah Johnson, experienced firsthand the challenges of finding quality 
              rental properties while dealing with unresponsive landlords and hidden fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Determined to create a better solution, she assembled a team of real estate professionals 
              and technology experts to build a platform that prioritizes user experience, transparency, 
              and quality service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, RentEase serves as a bridge between property owners and tenants, creating a 
              marketplace built on trust, efficiency, and mutual respect. We're proud to have helped 
              thousands of people find their perfect home and continue to grow our community every day.
